# SpiralTextAnimation

Welcome to SpiralTextAnimation, a simple web project that creates a spiral animation with text using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project showcases a creative use of CSS animations and JavaScript to generate a visually appealing spiral animation with the given text.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo [Click here](https://spiral-text-animation.vercel.app/).

## How it Works

- The HTML file (`index.html`) includes the structure of the web page with two spiral containers and a reference to the external styles in `style.css` and JavaScript in `script.js`.
- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) defines the text to be displayed and dynamically creates HTML elements for each character, assigning animation delays to create the spiral effect.
- The CSS file (`style.css`) contains styling for the overall layout, spiral animation, and individual characters.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vivek563/SpiralTextAnimation.git
```


2. Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

3. Explore the spiral animation with the provided text.

## Customize
- Feel free to customize the project by modifying the text, colors, or adjusting the animation properties in the CSS file.
